In python we use import to use a module/library into our project.
This is how we will import OS module in python. example:-
 import os We will quickly use the os module to display date and time from the operating system. 
 
 os.system("date") - 
 this will give you current date and time We can also create new files and folders using the os module. 
 To do so use --- os.mkdir("path with the name of the file/folder to create") example:- folder to create - newfolder os.mkdir("/home/rajeev/Documents/MovingFile/newFolder") -- here the folder i'm creating is newFolder so i have added it at the end of the path. check our current directory by using os.getcwd() To check if our file exists or not we can use another os module method called os.path.exists() This method can be also used to check whether the given path refers to an open file descriptor or not. example:- # importing os module import os # Specify path path = '/usr/local/bin/' # Check whether the specified path exists or not isExist = os.path.exists(path) print(isExist) os.path.splitext() method in Python is used to split the path name into a pair root(folder name) and ext(folder extension). Here, ext stands for extension and has the extension portion of the specified path while root is everything except ext part. It return a tuple data type of python. Tuple is same as lists but it cannot be modified and it uses Parentheses instead of brackets eg:- ("file" , ".txt") ext is empty if the specified path does not have any extension. If the specified path has a leading period (‘.’), it will be ignored. example:- # importing os module import os # path path = '/home/User/Desktop/file.txt' # Split the path in root and ext pair root_ext = os.path.splitext(path) # print root and ext of the specified path print("root part ", root_ext[0]) print("ext part " , root_ext[1], "\n") To get all the files and folders from a folder os module has os.listdir()
