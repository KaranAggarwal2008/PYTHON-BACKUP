There is another module Shutil module in Python provides many functions of high-level operations on files and collections of files. It comes under Pythonâ€™s standard utility modules. This module helps in automating the process of copying and removal of files and directories. Use shutil.copy() method to copy file from source to destination example:- # importing os and shutil module import os import shutil # path path = '/home/rajeev/Documents' # List files and directories in '/home/rajeev/Documents' print("Before copying file:") print(os.listdir(path)) # Source path source = "/home/rajeev/Documents/file.txt" # Destination path destination = "/home/rajeev/Documents/file(copy).txt" # Copy the content of source to destination dest = shutil.copy(source, destination) # List files and directories # in "/home / rajeev / Documents" print("After copying file:") print(os.listdir(path)) shutil.move() method Recursively moves a file or directory (source) to another location (destination) and returns the destination. If the destination directory already exists then src is moved inside that directory. Using shutil.move() method to move file from source to destination # importing os and shutil module import os import shutil # path path = '/home/rajeev/Videos' # List files and directories # in "/home/rajeev/Videos'' print("Before moving file:") print(os.listdir(path)) # Source path source = "/home/rajeev/Videos/mp4" # Destination path destination = "/home/rajeev/Videos/png" # Move the content of # source to destination dest = shutil.move(source, destination) # List files and directories in ""/home/rajeev/Videos" # Write the name of the directory here, that needs to get sorted # path = '/home/rajeev/Videos' path = input("enterthe name of the directory to be sorted :- ") # This will create a properly organized list with all the filename that is # there in the directory list_of_files = os.listdir(path) we want to seperate the files by their extension types. So first we need to get all the extensions of the files. we will loop on the list_of_files and use os.path.splitext() to get the the extensions and store them in ext vriable. # This will go through each and every file for file in list_of_files: name, ext = os.path.splitext(file) # This is going to store the extension type ext = ext[1:] # This forces the next iteration, # if it is the directory if ext == '': continue If there is an existing folder with the extension name, then we want to move the files with that extension to that folder. Else we want to create a new folder with that extension name and move the files to that folder. # This will move the file to the directory where the name 'ext' already exists if os.path.exists(path+'/'+ext): shutil.move(path+'/'+file, path+'/'+ext+'/'+file) # This will create a new directory,if the directory does not already exist else: os.makedirs(path+'/'+ext) shutil.move(path+'/'+file, path+'/'+ext+'/'+file)
